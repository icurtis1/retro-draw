# Stamp Images

Place your PNG files in this folder to use them as stamps in the drawing application.

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 32x32 to 64x64 pixels for best results
- File names should be descriptive (e.g., folder.png, trash.png, etc.)

The stamp tool will automatically scale these images based on the brush size setting.
